I installed my 16 GB's of RAM in my Mac Book Pro. It's purring like a kitten. Over the last couple of nights I built a new VM for my Windows Hacking. It's running 8.1 along with VS 2013 and MSSQL 2012. Plus some extras like Resharper. I really like having the additional RAM, it really helps when you want to leverage more of the technology you have.

I also updated this site with some plugins. Adding Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn. I also threw some google analytics on here.

This site is still in active development. I have a goal to try to contribute everyday to my GitHub repositories. I'm using this site as a launching pad to get me into a habit of hacking outside of work. I have a couple of side project I've been working. I hope to have an MVP up and running soon.

Check you later...
