I built Buena Healh for several reasons. The main ones were to help give me
experience a mobile application and to help me take a proactive role in managing my health.
It also was work that I used to satisfy requirements for my Masters of Science degree. 

I honestly was a little embarrased by the work I did. I seen some of my classmates projects and 
felt that my little app was sub par. Ultimately, it met the requirements for the course.

I haven't touched it in several months. However, I am still very much dedicated to taking making my
health a priority in my life and publishing an app to a mf'ing app store. 

With that. I've updated to the latest Xamarin bits. 

I'm going to pivot from Xamarin Forms and focus on Xamarin.Android. Android was my platform of choice
for many years. I've recommitted my self to Android and will work on getting Buena Health in the Google Play store.

I think I'll use the Xamarin Forms pieces for the Apple store and see how that works.
