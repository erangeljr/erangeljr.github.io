I've been teaching for the last 2 years. One thing that has been a pain point for
me is managing my classes grades and coursework. I've taught in several instituations and 
have been a student in many more. One thing that has been conistent in my experience is the vast
differences in how educators dissminate grades through out the semester.

For the last couple of years I've used spreadsheets which is pretty much the standard in academia. I've
also used open source course management systems like moodle. I very much like the feature rich offering of moodle.
However, I need an IT Dept. to manage it. With that said, not all of the courses I've taught were priveleged enough
to warrent a moodle component. 

I am committed to trying to fix this pain point for me and for the many part-time and full-time teachers who
want more control over their courses.
