#####Blogging

I've owned EddieRangel.com for more than 10 years now. It has seen many incarnations. From static html to being a Google Site. Prior to this it was a GitHub Page. It is now being hosted on [Ghost.org](http://github.com/erangeljr). 

#####Why the Change?

I've been wanting to refine my online web presence. I see many developers online who are doing amazing things. I want to build a presence that accomplishes what many others are doing. I have many code samples on [GitHub](http://github.com/erangeljr) but also would like a space to share my insight into what I do and how I do it.


#####Dev Career Boost
I'm not sure where I first heard about John Sonmez, but he kept popping up in different blogs and podcasts I follow. He has a blog called [SimpleProgrammer](http://simpleprogrammer.com/). I read about a course he offers that provides insight into how to market yourself as a developer by blogging, [DevCareerBoost](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/).

Given that this is something that I want to work on and develop, I went ahead and signed up for his offering. It did not hurt that it was free. I feel his course has provided me with some value into what I should be doing to market myself as a developer. This new blog and this post specifically could be attributed to me going through his course.

So, here's to my new blog!

Cheers!
