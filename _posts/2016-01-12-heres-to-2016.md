We're a couple of weeks into a new year and I want to get started working on some projects that I have been thinking about. 

* Contribute to an Open Source Project
* Develop a C# Programming Fundamentals course
* Develop a C# Intermediate Programming course
* Develop a Windows OS System Programming Course
* Pass Exam 70-483
* Deploy an app to Google Play

Undoubtedly, some of these items may be completed, removed and/or forgotten about. As an example, the 3 courses I've identified. I know I will not create 3 separate and complete courses. However, I am committed to creating content around those general areas and have it publicly accessible.

I've create a Trello board where I've added some details about each of these items. 

Here's to a new year, Cheers!!
