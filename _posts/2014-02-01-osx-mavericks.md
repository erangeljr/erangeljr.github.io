So, I finally upgraded the Mac Book Pro to OS X Mavericks. That's Version 10.9.1. So far it's working as anticipated. I've been poking around
to make sure nothing has broken. I've ordered some RAM to take it to 16 GB's, given that I'm now using this device as my primary hacking platform. I needed more
memory to support my Virtual Machines. Happy Hacking!!
