Are you a part of an Agile Software Development Team? How do you know? I've been reading the Agile Project Management book by Jim Highsmith. In his book he says, "Agility is principally about mindset, not practices." In his book he recommends asking yourself and/or Project Leaders a set of questions to assist in determining whether you have an agile mindset.

"In what specific ways and with what practices do you focous on value first and constraints last?"
"In what specific ways and with what practices do you manage teams rather than tasks?"
"In what specific ways and with what practices do you adapt to change rather than conform to plans?"

As I was reading through the first couple of chapters, I found myself relating to a lot of the pit falls people experience when they're working on Teams who are Agile In Name Only. Don't be AINO!
