The Spring Quarter at CSU, Bakersfield began last week. I am leading the Compilers
Course that is being offered in the Computer & Electrical Egineering and Computer Science
Department. 

I am very excited to have this opportunity. The curriculumn that I am using was developed by my
undergraduate adviser. It is my hope that I can leverage that existing curriculumn
and pivot some of the assignment to incorporate the .Net Compiler Platform "Roslyn". 

I've created a repo on GitHub to server as a place holder for the content I will be developing.
