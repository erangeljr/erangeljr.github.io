I've begun to outline a course on C#. It's not really a beginning course. It's really 
a rewrite of a Java course I took in college.

The Repo is on my github. I'm calling it core3900 for now. 

The point of this project is to collect a set of exercises that could be used to teach
yourself the C# programming langauge. 

This course will be a part of a series of lectures targeting the Windows Operating System.
