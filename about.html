<h3>Who I am</h3> 
<p>Hello, my name is Eddie Rangel. I am a Software Engineer, teacher, and all around Californian. I am also a husband and father. We currently reside in Bakersfield, CA.</P>


<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>
I am employed full time as a Software Engineer currently hacking on automation and optimization software for the oil and gas industry. I also teach part time at our local Community College. But please keep in mind this blog, its content and opinions are my own.
</p>

<h3>Why I do it</h3>
<p>
I am a little different then the rest of the Hackers on the interwebs. I didn't start programming at 7 or have some grand epiphany when I was 10 years old. My first PC was a Gateway when I was 16, it ran Windows 95. I used to play Command and Conquer in MS-DOS mode. 

After high school, I went to my local community college thinking I would be a Psychology major and maybe get a minor in History. However, I ended up in the U.S. Navy. It was in the Navy where I found out about technology and became intrigued about all things tech.

Once I seperated from service, I began my journey. I have not looked back since. 
 </p>
<h3>What I do for fun</h3>
<p>I try to spend as much time with my family as I can. Typically weekend getaways to the Coast.
